# Web Development Learning Projects

This repository contains small projects I built while learning web development.
Each project focuses on practicing specific concepts instead of being fully
production-ready applications.

The purpose of this repository is to track my learning progress and strengthen
fundamentals by building projects from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
