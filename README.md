# Web Development Learning Projects

This repository contains small to medium projects I built while learning web development.
The goal of this repo is to document my learning journey and practice core concepts by
building things from scratch instead of following copy-paste tutorials.

Each project focuses on specific fundamentals like DOM manipulation, JavaScript logic,
state management, APIs, and persistence.


## 📂 Projects

### 1. Todo App (Vanilla JavaScript)
A fully functional todo application built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository
- Strengthen fundamentals
- Build problem-solving skills
- Track learning progress over time
- Prepare for frameworks like React and backend development


## 📌 Notes
- These projects are learning-focused, not production-ready.
- Code is intentionally kept simple and readable.
- Each project has its own README explaining what was learned.
